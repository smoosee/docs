# cleanupBuild

This command will remove various files from the dist path. Only the file patterns you include are the ones ignored.

#### Options

_build.distPath_ - (default: dist)

Path of the dist directory that will be cleaned up after build.

_build.files_ - (default: [])

Files list that will be ignored during clean up. You do not need to input full names, this works like a glob.
